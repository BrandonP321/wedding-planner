Greetings from a fellow Seattleite! My name is Brandon Phillips and I'm working on an exciting venture to revolutionize the wedding planning industry. As someone who deeply appreciates the vibrant and unique wedding scene in the Greater Seattle Area, I'm reaching out to local experts like yourself for insights.
<br/>
<br/>
I believe that the best tools are built when they're informed directly by the professionals who'll use them. That's where you come in. I've created a survey aiming to better understand the experiences, needs, and challenges vendors like you face with current platforms. Your insights will be invaluable in shaping a tool that genuinely addresses your business needs.
<br/>
<ul>
<li><strong>Survey Link</strong>: https://forms.gle/zDT415of7ivgLrqKA</li>
<li><strong>Estimated Time</strong>: 5-10 minutes</li>
</ul>
Your responses will be kept strictly confidential and are solely for the purpose of improving our platform.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions or would like more information about our upcoming platform, I'm more than happy to discuss. Your feedback is an opportunity to play a part in revolutionizing the way wedding vendors connect with potential clients.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for your time and insights. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards,
